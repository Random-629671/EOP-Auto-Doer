## Known bug, milestone

 - OCR Bug:
     - In some case it will reconize "C" as "Cc" (need temp fix by change all "Cc" to "C" in code or fix OCR(impossible)) (patch released(not work lol))
     - Total OCR error:
       - "C" to "Cc" (temp fixed)
       - "g" to "a"
       - "j" to "1"
       - "i" to nothing (idk ask tesseract)
       - "rn" (in turn/internet) to "m"
       - Word got stick together ("It is" to "Itis", "AT and" to "ATand",...)
     - Also sometime misread the dot "." and other chacracters aswell! (patch released)
 - Task type:
   - Cannot work on word scramble task type (the task give a how to spell or a voice someone saying a word with a bunch of characters and force you to put the character in correct order)
   - On old task they somehow didn't use image mechanic but direct word as answer, just copy paste.
 - Stopping: the stop command still need to the run cycle to complete (?) (patch released(patch to patch the patch released))
 - Notifying: make a notify when unsupported task type or error appear
 - "cApTcHa": forgot to add a function to skip web stupid captcha (well, they don't even put a picture in their captcha lol)
